Shotgun: Oh man, are you a sight for sore eyes. I got some good news, pal. I'm your ticket out of here! 
Shotgun: On the other hand... well, there's no easy way to say this, but I'm cursed. Yup, my nanites got completely fried in my escape attempt... It's how I ended up here in the first place.... 
Shotgun: You look like you're tough enough to handle a few curses, though! Come on, let's get outta here!
